The android based mobile application “KP Traffic” is a platform that will facilitate the public as well as the traffic police officials in realtime, improving their existing traditional and inefficient way of registering complaints.

This application will solve and simplify 6 traffic related issues including:
# Complaints Module 
Where the public will be able to report complaints about problems, potential traffic violations and corrupt traffic wardens instantly.
# Live Traffic Updates 
The public will be able to check the traffic status in the form of either a busy, congested or a clear road.
# License verification 
This module will help the public to verify their driving license directly through the application in real time.
# Traffic Education 
This module will contain different graphical symbols meant to be used to educate people about traffic rules and regulations.
# Challan Verification  
To overcome corruption in Traffic Police, this module was developed for the public to verify the authenticity of traffic violation tickets.
